# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand patterns in passenger survival and builds a simple machine learning model to predict survival based on passenger attributes.

## Contents
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis of survival rates by gender, class, age, and family size.  
- **Visualizations**: Graphs to illustrate key insights.  
- **Predictive Model**: Logistic Regression model to predict survival.

## Files
- `Titanic Predictive Analysis.ipynb` – The main notebook.  
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis.

## Key Findings
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.  
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than third-class.  
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival odds.  
- Family size impacted survival, with some trends visible in siblings/spouses and parents/children.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
